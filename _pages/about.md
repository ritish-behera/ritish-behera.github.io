  Hi there! Thanks for hopping in, I am Ritish, a sophomore Master's in Sceince & Technology student in Engineering Physics with __electronics__ specialization at NIT Warangal. 

  My current work focuses on designing of faster and area efficient __Hybrid SRAM__ cells with heterogeneous integration of Si and MoS2 based FETs, under the supervision of Prof. V. Narender sir. 

  I am a __VLSI Technology__ enthusiast emphasizing on memory devices,layout designs, interconnect and parasitic modelling with having a strong understanding of complete RTL to GDS flow of VLSI design. Moreover, I have a strong grasp on digital electronics,analog electronics and device physics as well.

  Further, My interest lies in __physical designing__ of chips considering from floorplan-placement-Routing to physical synthesis and verification as well as clock tree synthesis and layout designing. 

About The Course
======
  The course __MSc(tech) engineering physics__ provides a comprehensive blend of physics and its technological aspects bridging the gap between engineers and physicist. It offers specializations in electronics and photonics. The elctronics specialization includes the __VLSI domain__ as well as __embedded system__ domain by providing courses like digital & analog electronics, digital circuit designing through verilog as well as hands on experience with __8086 microprocessor__ and __FPGA boards__. For a more detailed view you can check [Department of Physics, NIT Warangal](https://nitw.ac.in/physics)

My Skills
======
1. __EDA TOOLS__: Cadence Virtuoso, Sentaurus TCAD, OpenRoad, Xilinx Vivado, DEEDs
1. __LANGUAGES__: Verilog HDL, C++, Perl, Matlab
1. __ENVIRONMENTS__: Windows, Linux (Ubuntu)
1. __HANDS-ON__: 8086 Microprocessor, Artix 7 Pro FPGA Board

Activities
======
  I have worked as a __Joint Secretary__ in the Physics Association at NIT Warangal, where we were organizing events and co-curricular activities as part of tech-fests like Technozian 2022. Notably, we hosted talk shows featuring distinguished alumni, including Mr. Durga Prasad Allada, Vice President of Tech Mahindra. These endeavors significantly contributed to the success of our association during that academic year.

  As I do have some interests in social work, I always headed to joining such group of people around like __NSS, NIT Warangal__ as well as served as a social work __intern at SAMBHAJ NGO__ during my leisure time.

Summary
======
I am a passionate and work-driven personnel with a strong ambition to contribute to and grow within the semiconductor industry. I thrive in collaborative environments, where my team-oriented approach fosters innovation and drives results. With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to continuous learning, I aim to be a valuable asset to any semiconductor industry in the VLSI domain.
Thank you for your patience till this point.
