  Hi there! Thanks for hopping in, I am Ritish, a sophomore Master's in Sceince & Technology student in Engineering Physics with electronics specialization at NIT Warangal. 

  My current work focuses on designing of faster and area efficient hybrid SRAM cells with heterogeneous integration of Si and MoS2 based FETs, under the supervision of Prof. V. Narender sir. 

  I am a VLSI technology enthusiast emphasizing on memory devices,layout designs, interconnect and parasitic modelling with having a strong understanding of complete RTL to GDS flow of VLSI design. Moreover, I have a strong grasp on digital electronics,analog electronics and device physics as well.

  Further, My interest lies in physical designing of chips considering from floorplan-placement-Routing to physical synthesis and verification as well as clock tree synthesis and layout designing. 

About The Course
======
  The course MSc(tech) engineering physics provides a comprehensive blend of physics and its technological aspects bridging the gap between engineers and physicist. It offers specializations in electronics and photonics. The elctronics specialization includes the VLSI domain as well as embedded system domain by providing courses like digital & analog electronics, digital circuit designing through verilog as well as hands on experience with 8086 microprocessor and FPGA boards. For a more detailed view you can check [Department of Physics, NIT Warangal](https://nitw.ac.in/physics)

My Skills
======
1. EDA TOOLS: Cadence Virtuoso, Sentaurus TCAD, OpenRoad, Xilinx Vivado, DEEDs
1. LANGUAGES : Verilog HDL, C++, Perl, Matlab
1. ENVIRONMENTS: Windows, Linux (Ubuntu)
1. HANDS-ON: 8086 Microprocessor, Artix 7 Pro FPGA Board

Activities
======
  I have worked as a Joint Secretary in the Physics Association at NIT Warangal, where we were organizing events and co-curricular activities as part of tech-fests like Technozian 2022. Notably, we hosted talk shows featuring distinguished alumni, including Mr. Durga Prasad Allada, Vice President of Tech Mahindra. These endeavors significantly contributed to the success of our association during that academic year.

  As I do have some interests in social work, I always headed to joining such group of people around like NSS, NIT Warangal as well as served as a social work intern at SAMBHAJ NGO during my leisure time.
