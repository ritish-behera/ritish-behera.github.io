  Hi there! Thanks for hopping in, I am Ritish, a final year Master's in Sceince & Technology student in Engineering Physics with __electronics__ specialization at NIT Warangal. 

  My current work focuses on designing of faster and area efficient __Hybrid SRAM__ cells with heterogeneous integration of Si and MoS2 based FETs, under the supervision of Prof. V. Narender sir. 

  I am a __VLSI Technology__ enthusiast emphasizing on memory devices,layout designs, interconnect and parasitic modelling.

  Further, My interest lies in __physical designing__ of chips considering from floorplan-placement-Routing to physical synthesis and verification. 

Prior Experience
======
  I have worked as a research intern at IIT Gandhinagar during summer 2023, exploring a novel 3D SRAM cell architecture and its behaviour to noise. 
  Moreover, i explored different interconnect modelling techniques for memory subsytems.

My Skills
======
I am skilled with different programming language ranging from C++, MATLAB, Perl as well as experienced with using different leading EDA tools in the semiconducter industry like Cadence(virtuoso), Sentaurus TCAD, Xilinx Vivado.

I am well used to Windows OS as well as love to explore Linux OS for the practical application purposes.

Apart from this, I am recently being involved in some machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms and models to help grow my curiosity as well as my skill set. 

Activities
======
  I have worked as a __Joint Secretary__ in the Physics Association at NIT Warangal, where we were involved in organizing events and co-curricular activities such as tech-fests(Technozian 2022), exhibitions and talk-shows. 

  As I do like serving and being with people, I always headed to joining such group of individuals around myself. I was a part of __NSS, NIT Warangal__ as well as served as a social work __intern at SAMBHAJ NGO__ during my leisure time.

Summary
======
Indeed, I am an analytic and solution-oriented individual with a large chunk of curiosity in technology field. Apart from professional life, I love to spend my time exploring new things and new people as a hobby.
Thank you for the patience till the end.
