Hi there! Thanks for hopping in, this is Ritish, a sophomore Master's in Sceince & Technology student in Engineering Physics with electronics specialization at NIT Warangal. 

My current work focuses on designing of faster and area efficient hybrid SRAM cells with heterogeneous integration of Si and MoS2 based FETs, under the supervision of Prof. V. Narender sir. 

I am a VLSI technology enthusiast emphasizing on memory devices,layout designs, interconnect and parasitic modelling with having a strong understanding of complete RTL to GDS flow of VLSI design. Moreover, I have a strong grasp on digital electronics,analog electronics and device physics as well.

Further, My interest lies in physical designing of chips considering from placement-Routing to physical synthesis and verification as well as clock tree synthesis and layout designing. 

About My Course
======
The course MSc(tech) engineering physics provides a comprehensive blend of physics and its technological aspects bridging the gap between engineers and physicist.It offers specializations in electronics and photonics. The elctronics specialization includes the VLSI domain as well as embedded system domain by providing courses like digital & analog electronics, digital circuit designing through verilog as well as hands on experience with 8086 microprocessor and fpga boards. For a more detailed view you can check [Department of Physics, NIT Warangal](https://nitw.ac.in/physics)
