  Hi there! Thanks for hopping in, I am Ritish, a sophomore Master's in Sceince & Technology student in Engineering Physics with __electronics__ specialization at NIT Warangal. 

  My current work focuses on designing of faster and area efficient __Hybrid SRAM__ cells with heterogeneous integration of Si and MoS2 based FETs, under the supervision of Prof. V. Narender sir. 

  I am a __VLSI Technology__ enthusiast emphasizing on memory devices,layout designs, interconnect and parasitic modelling.

  Further, My interest lies in __physical designing__ of chips considering from floorplan-placement-Routing to physical synthesis and verification as well as clock tree synthesis and layout designing. 

Prior Experience
======
  I have worked as a research intern at IIT Gandhinagar during summer 2023, exploring a novel 3D SRAM cell architecture and its behaviour to noise. 
  Moreover, 

My Skills

Activities
======
  I have worked as a __Joint Secretary__ in the Physics Association at NIT Warangal, where we were organizing events and co-curricular activities as part of tech-fests like Technozian 2022. Notably, we hosted talk shows featuring distinguished alumni, including Mr. Durga Prasad Allada, Vice President of Tech Mahindra. These endeavors significantly contributed to the success of our association during that academic year.

  As I do have some interests in social work, I always headed to joining such group of people around like __NSS, NIT Warangal__ as well as served as a social work __intern at SAMBHAJ NGO__ during my leisure time.
