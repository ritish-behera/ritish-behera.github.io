The research work involved designing of a heterogeneous 6T SRAM cell consisting of Si cross-coupled inverter on the FEOL level and MoS2-FET based pass
transistor to be implemented on the BEOL level. Using cadence virtuoso tool, I
carried out circuit simulations for noise margin (read, write and hold) calculation
of the hybrid cell and further explored some potential solutions for interconnect
and parasitic modelling to describe the integration.
