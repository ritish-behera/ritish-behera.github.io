Using Cadence layout tools, designed feasible layouts of 6T SRAM cell which involved traditional layout as well as latest area efficient thin cell layout of the design. All the DRC rules were followed according to the 22nm FinFET technology node which provides better area efficiency and lower leakage currents as compared to the planar FETs due to its Fin like structures.
