This course covered the basics of semiconducter device technology, technology CAD and TCAD based technology design workflow with
emphasis on basic 2D device creation, device simulation and analysis. During the program, I created 2D PN junction device with appropriate
meshing on junctions followed by the device simulation for plotting the I-V characteristics of the same. I got to use the sdevice, svisual
and workbench environments during the process.

It was offered by Indian Intsitute of Science (IISc), Banglore in collaboration with Synopsys Inc.
