In the current scenario where using the commercial tools or software may feel expensive and difficult to master, 
the opensopurce EDA tools are trying to fill the gaps to reach the mass of semiconducter enthusisat. Opensource 
tools are great way to learn the semiconducter fabrication flow starting from logic synthesis to chip tape out. 
Though as of now the optimizations of the tools and model libraries are not upto the mark as compared to commercial 
ones on performance basis, it is still useful for beginners and may turn out as a great deal in the future too.

The following workshop involved the complete RTL to GDSII design flow of a RISC-V processor architecture while integrating a characterized custom cell considering  the total flow 
- RTL synthesis, static timing analysis, DFT, floorplan, placement, CTS, routing, physical verification 
as well as sign-off of the chip through the openLANE ASIC design flow with the Skywater 130nm PDK for all model libraries.
